          <p>This post distills key insights from my study of "Solana Blockchain Developer Bootcamp with Rust + JavaScript
            " by Arjun.</p>

          <h2>Applications of Solana</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Money Transfer: Cheaper and faster</li>
            <p>Voting: Transparent and secure</p>
            <p>RealState: Tokenization of properties</p>
            <p>Lending and Borrowing: DeFi</p>
            <p>Healthcare: Medical records can be stored in a secure way</p>
            <p>Gambling: Fair and transparent</p>
            <p>Supply Chain: Tracking of products</p>
            <p>NFTs and Gaming: Digital assets</p>
          </ul>

          <br/>
          <h2>What is Solana?</h2>
          <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. Solana is a high-performance blockchain that can scale to thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for decentralized applications and crypto projects.</p>
          <p>Solana Transactions can use "programs" written in Rust, a systems programming language that is known for its speed and safety. Solana also supports JavaScript for building front-end applications that interact with the blockchain.</p>
          <p>Programs replace the middlemen in complex transactions.</p>
          <p>Ethereum also has smart contracts, but they are slow and expensive.</p>
          <p>Solana is faster, cheaper, and easier to program than Ethereum.</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>Airdropping - Projects</h2>
          <p>Airdropping means generate SOL and send it directly to your own wallet.</p>
          <p>Fake Solana currency can be used to test features without spending real money.</p>
          <p><b>Assumed Knowledge Required:</b> Node & JavaScript</p>
          <p>Project Link: https://github.com/jorgermduarte/solana-airdrop</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>What is a Token?</h2>
          <p>A token is a digital asset that represents ownership of something.</p>
          <p>Solana vs real-life tokens:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solana</li>
            <ul>
              <li>No Middle man needed</li>
              <li>difficult to forge because of blockchain</li>
              <li>easy and cheap to create</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Real-life</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Middle man needed</li>
              <li>easy to forge</li>
              <li>costs money to manufacture</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>Theory on NFTs and Metaplex Candy Machine</h2>
          <p>What's a non-fungible token(NFT)? It's a unique digital asset that can be bought and sold.</p>
          <p>Soo whats the difference between tokens and NFTs? Tokens are fungible, meaning they can be exchanged for each other. NFTs are unique and can't be exchanged for each other.</p>
          <p>Giving Picasso as an example, Each NFT is signed with Picasso's Solana wallet, making it unique.</p>
          <p>In Solana, we can create, mint, and sell NFTs using Metaplex Candy Machine.</p>
          <p>Metaplex is the NFT Standard for Solana.</p>
          <p>Metaplex has already written programs that will help us create our own NFTs out of the box.</p>
          <p>Metaplex allows an user to randomly mint NFTs.</p>
          <p>Prerequisites: Some JS + command-line experience + Solana installed on your computer</p>

          <br/>
          <h2>What is Chainlink?</h2>
          <p>Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data.</p>
          <p>Chainlink makes it possible for solana projects to interact with real-world high quality data.</p>
          <p>How it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Node operator puts data + deposits money on Chainlink network</li>
            <li>If bad-quality data, node operator loses deposit</li>
            <li>If good-quality data, node operator earns more money.</li>
          </ul>
